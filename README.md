# Project-Sunny
An Android based Chat Application.The application has been designed using Figma and the designs have been successfully brought to life using Android Studio. 
The layouts have been coded in XML(Extensible Mark-up Language) using the inbuilt editor provided by Android Studio in collaboration with JetBrains and intelliJ.
The functionality has been implemented using Java and the inbuilt libraries provided by Android. The project has been migrated to androidx to prevent any degeneration
due to previous versions. 

The chat application has been divided into different activities to give dynamic results. There are the following activities available in the application.
-Launch Activity( Java implementation code+XML layout)
-Sign Up Activity( Java implementation code+XML layout)
-Sign In Activity(Java implementation code+XML layout)
-Main Activity( Java implementation code+XML layout)
-Chat Window( Java implementation code+XML layout)
-Settings Activity(Java implementation code+XML layout)

Database has been accessed using Firebase and Firebase authentication has been done successfully. The assets used in the application have also been attached. Thus, this is
an overall package of the design, layouts, functionality implementation, assets and values.

Here's to contributing my share to the coding world!
